## 🌐 Part of the Maximum Reality Network
Omni-Azul is a specialized module of the **[Maximum Reality](https://maximumreality.xyz)** ecosystem, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, digital efficiency, and the exploration of the megadiverse world.

## 🧠 Developer Notes: The "Whole" Perspective
Omni-Azul was built on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, marking a return to HTML/JS after a 25-year "system sleep." 

This interface reflects a "Systems Thinking" philosophy—stripping away the fragmented, disconnected UI of the modern web to provide a direct "Root Access" to information. It is designed for those who process the world not in parts, but as an interconnected whole. Every line of code is a public commit, documenting the journey of a human processor navigating the gap between legacy memory and modern syntax.
